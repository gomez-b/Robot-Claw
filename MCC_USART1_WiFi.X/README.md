We've created a connection between the ESP8266-01 WiFi module and the PIC18F46K42 microcontroller. Our goal was to create a code that enabled us to communicate effortlessly with the WiFi module through a set of AT commands. This configuration would allow us to achieve two key objectives: firstly, establishing a secure connection to a local WiFi network, and secondly, creating a robust link to ThingSpeak's server. This server would readily accept data from our microcontroller and present it in a real-time data monitoring and analysis.
